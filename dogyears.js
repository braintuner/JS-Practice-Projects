//Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
var myAge=27;
var earlyYears=2;
earlyYears*=10.5;
myAge-=2;
var laterYears=myAge;
laterYears*=4;
console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);
var myAgeInDogYears=earlyYears+laterYears;
var myName='Niyam.toLowerCase()';
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`)
